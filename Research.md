# Research and concept
## Dataset
The data used for training this prototype was the [PSG-Audio dataset](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-021-00977-w).
The dataset is described by the authors as 
> the first open access dataset, comprising 212 polysomnograms along with synchronized high-quality tracheal and ambient microphone recordings.

They further write:
> We envision this dataset to be widely used for the development of home-based apnea detection techniques and frameworks.

This is one of the aims of this project.
