*The sleep apnea syndrome (SAS) is a breathing disorder occurring as a repetitive cessation or
severe reduction of breathing, leading to disrupted sleep. Although it was noticed even before
1900, under the term 'Pickwickian syndrome', in exceptional cases linked to obesity and
hypersomnolence, SAS was recognized as a pathological chronic condition only after 1970. Since then,
various studies attempted to determine the SAS relationship with age
or gender and with pathological conditions like obesity, hypertension, diabetes mellitus,
previously reported stroke or cardiovascular diseases and cancer.

The SAS symptoms include daytime fatigue and sleepiness, headaches, depression or
mood changes, disrupted interpersonal relationships38, reduced cognitive performance
and increased risk of work and vehicle accidents. Despite the symptoms’ severity, the
awareness of the syndrome remains restricted. The epidemiological studies on apnea prevalence
in the general population exhibit increased inconsistency (3–7% for men, 2–5% for women).
This is mainly attributed to the medical protocols’ differences. However, the restricted number
of people seeking diagnosis also strongly contributes to SAS prevalence underestimation.*
